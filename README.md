# fun-seo-refactor

## Project Description
In this project we were tasked with refactoring some code for the provided finished website. There were several changes that needed to be made to the exsisting code just to make the website run better and to make sure everything looked and worked correctly. The first thing that was listed on the outline to do was to create semantic HTML elements throughout the page. The page started with using mostly div tags and those needed to be changed. They were all replaced with either section tags, article tags, aside tags, and footer tags used throughout the page. The next task was done by reorganizing some of the HTML and CSS to make more sense and take up less space. There was white space that needed to be removed. There was also some issues with how the styling was setup and one of those issues was fixed by adding another section with a class in the aside. This allowed for much easier styling when going into the CSS sheet. Speaking of the CSS sheet, it was completely reorganized so that the elements were styled in the order they appeared on the page. There was also serval instances where the code was able to be condensed so that there were less lines of code on the CSS sheet. The next thing outlined to do was adding alt attribute to all the images. The images were also all able to be resized so that they still fit in the area they needed to go however they would not take nearly as long to load. The alt attributes can also help with Searh Engine Optimization which is another thing that was outlined in the assignment. There was also an issue where the headings were not using sequential order all the way through. There was one example towards the bottom of the page where an h2 tag was used after an h3 tag and had to also be changed to an h2. The page also lacked a title which is something else that adds to the Search Engine Optimization of a page. There were other small examples of things to fix like on of the internal links not functioning properly and an id class needed to be added to one of the links. There was also some slight styling that could be updated to make the links look better.
